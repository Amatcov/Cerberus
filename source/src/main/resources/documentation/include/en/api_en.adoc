When integrating Cerberus with any external tool, public API must be used.
All public API are version managed in order to allow secure and stable integration.
Each time the signature of the API is modified or behaviour has changed, it is implemented on a new version keeping existing version only subject to bugfix changes.

Old version of Public API can disappear (after a deprecated period) from one version to another.
In order to perform the impact analysis of the systems that are calling your Cerberus installation, you can use the parameter cerberus_log_publiccalls.
Setting the parameter to Y will log every public API calls performed reporting any deprecated calls that needs to be migrated to newer version of the same API.
