* A Bug has been fixed on useStep that are not correctly referenced. SQL #1247 will clean badly reference Steps. You can get that list before beeing automaticly cleaned with SQL : SELECT a.* from testcasestep a LEFT OUTER JOIN testcasestep b on a.usesteptest=b.test and a.usesteptestcase=b.testcase and a.usestepstep=b.step WHERE b.test is null and a.usesteptest is not null and a.usesteptest != ''
