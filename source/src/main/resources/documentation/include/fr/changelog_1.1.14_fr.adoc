*Improvements / New features*
[square]
* [ENGINE] new parameter : cerberus_queueexecution_timeout in order to set the timeout when execution is triggered from the queue.
* [GUI] Queue can now be administered from the GUI. Every queue execution can be CANCELLED or modified and resubmitted to WAITING. State workflow documented in doc folder.
* [ENGINE] Retry on an execution now generate new execution on the queue. That allow the feature to work on sync and async mode.
* [GUI] Added 2 buttons on TestCaseExecution page in order to view the prameters of the corresponding Queue and create a new queue from the existing one.
* [ENGINE] New queueing system that allow 3 level of constrains:
    1/global Cerberus level --> parameter : cerberus_queueexecution_global_threadpoolsize
    2/Application environment level that can be configured in application modal at environment level (poolsize)
    3/Robot IP level that can be configured in invariant table ROBOTHOST invariant (gp1 needs to be feeded with integer value) Default value taken from parameter : cerberus_queueexecution_defaultrobothost_threadpoolsize
    Execution will be taken from the Queue (QUEUED state) and triggered ASAP until any of the constrain are reached.
    Queue screen allow to control the result and followup the executions.
    1st tab display the list of queue execution, 2nd tab the list of constrain and level of saturation of every constrain, the 3rd tab disply the timing of the last job that analysed the queue and allow to force a new trigger of that job (should be automatic at the end of every queue successfully submitted).

*Warning to be considered before applying the version (deprecated features)*
