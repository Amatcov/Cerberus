* KO : The execution was performed correcly and at least one control failed resulting a global KO. That means that a bug needs to be reported to development teams.
* FA : The execution did not performed correctly and needs a correction from the team that is in charge of managing the testcases. It couls be a failed SQL or action during the test.
* NA : Test could not be executed as a data could not be retreived. That probably means that the test is not possible in the current environment/status.
